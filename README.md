# Customer_Segmentation
Segmentation using K-Means clustering algorithm
Suppose that we have a company that selling some of the product, and you want to know how well does the selling performance of the product.

You have the data that can we analyze, but what kind of analysis that we can do?

Well, we can segment customers based on their buying behaviour on the market.

Keep in mind that the data is really huge, and we can not analyze it using a bare eye. We have to use machine learning algorithms and the power of computing for it.


Plan Of Attack
Before we get into the process, I will give you a brief on what kind of steps we will get.

Gather the data
Pre-process the data
Explore the data
Cluster the data
Interpret the result
